description: '"Jack Knox adored the beautiful Margery, but unfortunately she adored
  the less-than-reputable Harry Wardrop. That was problem enough for the attorney,
  but when Margery''s father, a corrupt politician named Allan Fleming went missing,
  things took a decidedly nasty turn. The worst of it was discovering Fleming''s body
  at the shoddy social club called The White Cat."'
